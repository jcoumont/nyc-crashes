# Data preprocessing - NYC Motor Vehicle Crashes

## Mission objectives

- Be able to use pandas
- Be able to clean a data set
- Be able to do prepare a data set for a machine learning model

## The Mission

Bill de Blasio, mayor of New York City, is in a bit of a pickle. Indeed, his police department, the NYPD, collected information about all the traffic accidents that happened in New York City. However, they are too busy eating doughnuts to correctly encode each traffic indicent, and so it happens that the dataset that we got here is quite dirty, has a lot of missing values and can't be used by a machine learning model as is.
Can you help Mr. de Blasio and shine a new light on his police department ?
I am sure that you are well equipped to handle this.

### Must-have features

[ ]The dataset contains no missing values ("" or null)
[ ]No duplicates
[ ]Values are consolidated
[ ]Data format is correct
[ ]No blank spaces (ex: " I love python " => "I love python")

### Nice-to-have features

[ ] The more rows of data you use, the better. However, pay attention that the more data you have, the longer each operation needs to execute.
[ ] Add new features computed using the features present that you think are going to be useful.
[ ] Apply the preprocessing steps needed so that a future machine learning model can make the best use out of it **(feature selection, feature engineering, feature normalization, and resampling)**. You have to decide which one are necessary and which ones aren't.
